            <h3>Early Life of Abel</h3>
            <p>Abel was born on February 16, 1990 and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He was raised in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. 
                He is an only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu. Abel talks about his childhood and how he has an estranged relationship with 
                his father and would only see him every few years. He talks about him not being a bad father, rather he was just never around. He dropped out of high school 
                and moved in with a couple of his friends. They lived a more “free” lifestyle where he ended up homeless at times and had been incarcerated on several occasions.

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Abel has said that Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly were his main musical inspiration artists. Michael Jackson’s 
                music was a big key in wanting him to become a singer, and he’s referenced a few songs including “Dirty Diana” as 
                one example. His vocal style has been influenced by Ethiopian singers, one of them being Aster Aweke. He discussed 
                how he is heavily influenced by 1980’s music and gives credit to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for opening 
                his eyes to the music of that era. </p>
