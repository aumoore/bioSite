                <h3>Early Life of Abel</h3>
                <p>Abel was born on February 16, 1990 and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He was raised in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. 
                    He is an only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu. Abel talks about his childhood and how he has an estranged relationship with 
                    his father and would only see him every few years. He talks about him not being a bad father, rather he was just never around. He dropped out of high school 
                    and moved in with a couple of his friends. They lived a more “free” lifestyle where he ended up homeless at times and had been incarcerated on several occasions.

                <h3>Music Journey</h3>
                <p>Abel started his music journey off by releasing songs anonymously (original alias on Youtube was xoxxxoooxo) on Youtube for a while 
                    before meeting a producer named Jeremy Rose.
                    Jeremy then helped produce three tracks with Abel; “What You Need”, “Loft Music”, and “The Party & The After Party” to which 
                    were abandoned by Jeremy to Abel under the condition that he would receive credit for them if they were ever 
                    successful. Abel posted two of these three tracks; “What You Need” and “Loft Music” to Youtube and eventually 
                    gained traction to which was acknowledged by rapper Drake. These then started getting coverage from multiple 
                    media outlets including Pitchfork and The New York Times. At this point he had settled on “The Weeknd” for his stage name. The removal of 
                    the ‘e’ was intentional so he could avoid any trademark issues with the Canadian pop rock band “the Weekend”. 
                    He also discussed how his stage name was chosen in tribute to the time he left school, took his mattress, 
                    and left one weekend and never came home.</p>
